To apply the fix for the repeating "Projects directory not found" error:

1. The fix has been applied to src-tauri/src/commands/agents.rs
   - Changed log::error! to log::debug!
   - Returns empty output instead of error
   - This prevents the continuous error messages

2. You need to rebuild Claudia:
   ```cmd
   cd C:\Development\claudia
   bun run build
   bun run tauri build
   ```

3. After rebuilding, the error message will no longer appear in the console
   - The agent will continue to work correctly
   - The debug message will only appear in debug logs, not in the console

Alternative: If you don't want to rebuild right now, you can ignore the error messages as they don't affect functionality.
